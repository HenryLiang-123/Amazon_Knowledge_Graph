# Can LLMs learn Knowledge Graphs?

The objective of the project is to : 

1. Develop efficient prompting to identify differences in two graphs.

2. Apply different prompting techniques such as zero shot learning, few shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

3. Understand the current bounds to LLMâ€™s understanding of Graphs.

4. Test final prompting technique on desired dataset.
